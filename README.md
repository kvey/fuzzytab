# FuzzyTab

Resolving a personal annoyance.
Tabs are searched on a per window basis and completion will jump to the selected tab.

## Todo
*  Revise the third-party fuzzy library to be more generally useful.
*  Clean up code
*  Add content-script key shortcut

## Ideas
*  Content-script input rather than omnibox to allow for instant-search (with localstorage to sync ui between tabs)
